# Sage & Spoon — Engineering Roadmap

A prioritized backlog distilled from a multi-angle audit (security · GD medical
safety · architecture · testing · accessibility · performance/PWA · AI/data
pipeline). Items are grouped by priority and tagged with **status** and
**effort** (S ≈ <½ day, M ≈ 1–2 days, L ≈ multi-day). Each item names the
file/function so it can be picked up cold.

**Status legend:** ✅ done · 🔶 partial · ⬜ open

**Guiding rule:** the GD constraints are load-bearing (see `CLAUDE.md`). Carb
caps, allergen exclusions, GI limits, and "not medical advice" honesty come
before features. For safety logic, a false-negative (serving an allergen /
over-cap / wrong-GI meal) is worse than a false-positive — bias every trade-off
toward caution.

## Where things stand (2026-06-19)

The original six-angle audit's **P0 (safety)** is complete, and most of **P1
(images/perf)** has shipped. A second audit (this one) verified those, then
found one **live exclusion failure** (fish) and a few correctness gaps; the
safety subset of that is now fixed (Phase 1 below). The codebase is well
-architected and the *runtime AI safety* is genuinely strong (layered,
fail-closed, never clamps carbs). The remaining course-correction is to:

1. make the **local/bundled/import path** enforce the GD rules as strictly as the
   AI path (Phase 1 — ✅ done);
2. **offline + load-time** — photos persist in a permanent SW cache
   (`OFFLINE-CACHE` ✅), the image table is split out of the main chunk
   (`PERF-3` ✅, 124→96 KB gzip), and Settings no longer waits on the cookbook
   (`PERF-6` ✅);
3. ✅ **architecture & perf paydown landed** — `usePersistentState` (`ARCH-2`),
   the ingredient-names prop (`ARCH-1`), and card-render perf via the React
   Compiler (`PERF-7`, app-wide auto-memoization);
4. decide the **backend-proxy** fork (blocks sharing, key security, and feeding
   user photos back into the shared library) — see P6.

---

## ✅ Done

**Breakfast cuisine diversity** (597 → 628 recipes): +31 breakfasts targeting
the five cuisines the library barely touched at breakfast (Indian 4→11, Asian
2→9, Middle Eastern 2→8, Mexican 5→10, Italian 0→6), leaving American comfort
(79) and Mediterranean (26) untouched. Masala omelettes, besan chilla, tofu
bhurji, shakshuka, huevos a la Mexicana, frittatas, and more — all through the
same `validate-drafts.mjs` + `recipes:promote` gates (0 rejected, 0 duplicate
flags on both checks). Coverage floor ratcheted (breakfast 149). This was the
last clear, evidence-based gap; further growth risks contrived variations
rather than real coverage, so the library growth pass stops here.

**Light-protein mains expansion** (497 → 597 recipes): +60 dinners and +40
lunches with <20g est. protein per serving — the segment the library lacked
(only 6 dinners / 22 lunches qualified before; now 66 / 62). Veg-, egg-, dairy-
and legume-forward plates plus small-portion fish/meat, spread across all 7
cuisines, all through the promote gates (carb caps, GI, pairing, exclusions,
carb-calibration). Authored via `scripts/validate-drafts.mjs`, a dev harness
that pre-checks drafts against the app's own nutrition estimator and vet rules.
Coverage floors ratcheted up (lunch 149, dinner 174).

**Original hardening pass** (231 tests): real Openverse photos for all 497
recipes; expanded `ALLERGEN_MAP` synonyms (Shellfish→crab/…, Tree nuts→coconut/…,
Dairy→ghee/whey/…); free-text allergy expansion (`expandToken`); `placeMeal`
cap+exclusion guard; `pickBest` determinism; image `referrerPolicy` + Flickr
downscaling.

**P0 safety pass** (#34/#35/#36): runtime GD predicate (`gdCompliant`),
reject-not-clamp on AI carb overruns, compound-aware allergen matcher (plant
-qualifier guard), carb cross-check, cap upper-bound hint, backup re-vet. → all
of **SAFE-1…SAFE-7** resolved.

**Image / PWA pass** (#37–#40 + follow-ups): network-first SW (PERF-5),
de-blocked fonts (PERF-4), 913 self-hosted photos + visible detail-modal
attribution (PERF-1/2, partial — see below), shared `<NutritionPills>` (ARCH-4),
`ErrorBoundary` (ARCH-3), `RECIPE_SERVINGS` helper (ARCH-9), `finally` resets
(ARCH-5), single `setPlan` in `buildWeek` (ARCH-10); a11y: aria-live toasts +
moving banner (A11Y-1), `aria-current` + `<h1>` (A11Y-2), modal scroll-lock
(A11Y-3).

**Photos & UX pass** (PR #41, 332 tests): cook-supplied photos (canvas resize →
IndexedDB), multi-photo gallery, clickable cards, shopping-list editing + Web
Share, hide recipes, "My Saved Recipes" quick-link, delete custom recipes,
persisted shopping edits, iOS A2HS banner.

**Safety hardening — audit Phase 1** (339 tests): `FISH-1`, `GD-LOCAL`,
`PIPELINE-DRIFT`, `SEC-2` (export side), plus new CI invariants. See P0 below.

**Offline & load-time — audit Phase 2** (342 tests): `OFFLINE-CACHE` (permanent
SW photo cache + app-shell precache), `PERF-3` (image table code-split out of the
main chunk: 124→96 KB gzip), `PERF-6` (Settings renders without waiting on the
cookbook chunk).

**Architecture & robustness — audit Phase 3** (345 tests): `ARCH-2`
(`usePersistentState`), `ARCH-1` (ingredient-names prop), `PR41-SHOP` (week-keyed
ShoppingTab), `A11Y-4` (MealCard Space activation), `CLAUDE-ROBUST` (defensive
fetch parse + 429/529 retry); reset now also clears IndexedDB photos.

**Accessibility & CI gates — Sprints A/B** (347 tests): skip-link + `OfflineBanner`
(`A11Y-8`), real gallery-dot buttons (`A11Y-4`), tap targets (`A11Y-7`), clamp
announce (`A11Y-6`); coverage gate (`TEST-6`, ≥68%), Node 22 LTS + `engines`
(`TEST-7`), `dist` build-smoke (`TEST-8`), and `npm audit fix` (0 vulnerabilities).

**Robustness, photos & perf polish — Sprints D/E** (354 tests): `SAFE-9` (broader
added-sugar denylist), `SEC-3` (bounded AI strings), `ARCH-8` (pipeline-aligned
dedupe), `PR41-PHOTOS` (backup round-trip + quota toast + EXIF auto-orient),
`PERF-8` (responsive `srcset`), `PERF-9` (PNG manifest icons), `IMG-LICENSE`
(redistributable allowlist before self-hosting).

**Security & cleanups — Sprint C** (360 tests): `SEC-1` (build-only CSP locking
connect-src to self + Anthropic), `ARCH-6` (fenced-block `extractJSON`), `A11Y-7`
(tab-bar tap targets), `A11Y-8` (Android/desktop `beforeinstallprompt` install).

**Accessibility & test depth** (#42): `A11Y-4` (card nested-interactive
violation resolved by de-roling, drag preserved), `TEST-5` (seeded `pickBest`),
`TEST-2/3` (AI-swap error path + malformed-backup coverage).

**Attribution & contrast — Sprint F** (#43): `PERF-2` (visible CC-BY/BY-SA
credit overlay on cookbook cards — creator · LICENSE, `pointerEvents:none`,
suppressed for cook photos and where the detail figcaption already credits), and
`A11Y-5` (filter toggle chips gain a check-icon on-state cue so state isn't
colour/opacity alone).

**Nutrition matcher — Sprint G** (371 tests): `SAFE-8` (last open P0) —
`lookupIngredient` is now word-boundary aware like the exclusion matcher (no more
"graham cracker"→ham cross-word mis-estimates; 0 recognition loss across all 2341
bundled ingredient lines, calibration still green), and `proteinEstimateReliable`
flags a protein-category ingredient that mis-matches a near-zero-protein entry,
not just unrecognised ones. **All P0 (safety) items are now resolved.**

**Robustness & coverage — Sprint H** (375 tests): `ARCH-7` (quota-overflow toast —
`store.set` reports persistence + a one-shot `onStorageFull` listener, distinct
from an absent store) and `TEST-2` (AI-swap **success** path: a GD-passing idea
commits with a "Swapped in" toast, alongside the existing error path).

**Performance — Sprint I** (375 tests): `PERF-7` — enabled the **React Compiler**
(`babel-plugin-react-compiler`, `target: '19'`) in the Vite React plugin, so the
whole app auto-memoizes (the ~42 plan cards no longer re-render on every
toast/selection tick) without hand-rolled `useCallback`/`memo`. Verified the
built bundle emits the memo-cache runtime; tests/lint/build/CSP all still green.

**Test depth — Sprint J** (382 tests): closed the last three testing gaps.
`TEST-2` — AI **success** paths now covered end to end: generate-week (a 7-day
plan whose slots all pass `gdCompliant` commits + persists the new meals),
grow-cookbook (vetted ideas land in `custom` with the success toast), and
ingredient suggestions (Claude's vetted matches render under "Fresh ideas from
Claude", and a GD-breaking idea is filtered before display). `TEST-3` —
`loadCookbook` reject → `CORE_DB` fallback (the shell resolves instead of hanging
on the skeleton) and null-slot rendering (empty-slot affordance, no crash).
`TEST-8` — added a `jest-axe` accessibility smoke on Onboarding (page-structure
rules scoped out since the component renders standalone).

**Offline images — Sprint K** (383 tests): `IMG-REMOTE` — the library is now
**fully self-hosted (zero remote photos)**. Root cause: `fetch-images.mjs`
sourced from (and even *preferred*) rawpixel/StockSnap/WordPress, which 403 a
server-side download, so those photos could never be self-hosted and always
stayed a runtime dependency. Taught the fetcher to reject non-self-hostable
hosts and to accept an `--ids` target list, re-sourced the 57 affected recipes
from Wikimedia Commons + Flickr, self-hosted them to local WebP (962 photos ×
2 widths), and renormalised filenames to positional keys. 3 recipes with no
on-topic redistributable match fall back to the clean gradient.

**Final polish — Sprint L** (387 tests): closed the last two open nits, so every
backlog table item is now ✅. `IMG-LICENSE` — the self-host fetch uses an honest,
descriptive User-Agent (per Wikimedia's UA policy) instead of a spoofed Chrome
string; the spoof only existed for rawpixel/StockSnap, which IMG-REMOTE no longer
sources. `CLAUDE-ROBUST` — the AI model is now a Settings picker (`AI_MODELS`:
Sonnet 4.6 default · Opus 4.8 best-quality · Haiku 4.5 fastest), threaded through
every `callClaude` path; `resolveModel` clamps any stray/imported id back to the
default. The default stays Sonnet 4.6 — raising it would silently increase the
cook's API spend; best-quality is one tap away for sharper GD reasoning.

**Audit hardening — Sprint M** (394 tests): a top-to-bottom audit surfaced two
GD-safety gaps of the load-bearing "incomplete map" class (the FISH-1 failure
mode), both on the AI / free-text surface where ingredient names are
unconstrained. `SAFE-ALLERGEN` — broadened `ALLERGEN_MAP`: named cheeses that
don't contain "cheese" (paneer, halloumi, gruyère…), molluscs (calamari, squid,
octopus, langoustine), pastas/breads/wheat grains by name (couscous, naan,
seitan, rye, panko…), soy products (tempeh, miso, tamari), and hidden-egg items
(mayonnaise, aioli, meringue) — all word-boundary/plant-guarded so tamarind≠
tamari, rice-noodles≠wheat, pitaya≠pita. `SAFE-SUGAR` — broadened
`hasGdBannedIngredient`: sugary sauces/condiments (teriyaki, hoisin, sweet
chili, ketchup, jam/jelly/marmalade), `\bsweetened\b` (minus unsweetened), and
white-by-nature carbs (jasmine/sushi/sticky rice, baguette/ciabatta/naan). Both
verified against the live matchers and added removal tests; the reassembled
cookbook still passes every compliance/pool-depth assertion (zero false
positives). The audit also fixed three UI-state bugs (`removeUserPhoto`
silent-failure, stale tap-to-move/placement picks surviving a plan regenerate,
shopping-extras keyed by array index) and locked the two load-bearing AI/manual
GD rails with end-to-end tests (an over-cap AI slot is swapped for a safe
cookbook meal; an excluded cookbook meal can't be placed into the plan).
Follow-ups (`SAFE-PAIR`): tightened the carb-pairing rule from ≥20g to **≥12g**
so a low-protein ~15g snack can't pass — GD guidance pairs all meaningful carbs,
not just large ones. Applied to **both** the AI gate (`gdCompliant`'s
`CARB_PAIRING_MIN`) and the shipped-cookbook invariant in `coverage.test.js`. The
one cookbook recipe that fell short at the new bar (*Almond Stuffed Dates* —
2 dates + 8 almonds, ~3g protein+fat) was re-curated rather than dropped:
doubling the almonds to 16 pairs the date sugar properly (now ~7g), the correct
dietitian fix. Edited in both `generated-meals.js` and its curated source
(`batch5`) since `promote` is append-only; library stays 497/497.

> **Backlog status:** every P0–P5 item is resolved. What remains is **P6** —
> product direction and the deliberate backend-proxy fork — which are decisions,
> not defects.

## P0 — Safety (do first)

| St | ID | Item | Sev | Where | Fix | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | SAFE-1 | GD rules were prompt-only, not runtime-enforced. | High | `claude.js` | `gdCompliant` enforces cap, explicit-Low GI, added-sugar/juice/white denylist, carb cross-check, carb↔protein/fat pairing on every AI path. | M |
| ✅ | SAFE-2 | AI over-cap meals were clamped (falsifying the carb number). | High | `App.jsx` `generateAIWeek`/`aiSwap` | Reject + cookbook substitution; never clamp. | S |
| ✅ | SAFE-3 | Substring allergen matching over/under-matched. | Med | `planner.js` `keywordHit` | Word-boundary + plural + plant-qualifier guard; bare butter/cream safely under Dairy. | M |
| ✅ | SAFE-4 | `vetNewMeals` trusted authored carbs/GI. | Med | `claude.js` | `estimateCarbs` cross-check (`CARB_DIVERGENCE`); GI must be explicit Low. | M |
| ✅ | SAFE-5 | Macro pills could read misleadingly low for unrecognized ingredients. | Med | `NutritionPills.jsx`, `nutrition.js` | Visible "est." label; `proteinEstimateReliable` → "protein n/a". | S |
| ✅ | SAFE-6 | Carb caps had no upper-bound warning. | Low | `SettingsTab.jsx` | Non-blocking over-guidance hint (`role="note"`). | S |
| ✅ | SAFE-7 | Backup restore didn't re-validate meals. | Low | `App.jsx` `importData` | Re-vet imported custom meals (`mealSafe`, now incl. GI). | M |
| ✅ | **FISH-1** | **Live exclusion failure:** finned fish had no allergy chip and the "Fish" dislike matched only salmon/cod/tuna — ~74 cookbook recipes (tilapia/halibut/trout/mackerel/sardines/white fish) still served to fish-averse users. | **Crit** | `meals.js` `ALLERGEN_MAP`/`DISLIKE_MAP`/`QUIZ`; `planner.js` aliases | Shared `FISH` keyword set → new Fish allergy chip + fixed Fish dislike; broadened Onions/Spicy; free-text fish/seafood aliases; independent-detector CI test that asserts *removal*, not pool size. | M |
| ✅ | **GD-LOCAL** | GD rules enforced on the AI path but only cap+exclusions on the local/place/import path — a custom/imported High/unknown-GI meal could be planned. | High | `planner.js` `mealSafe`; `App.jsx` `placeMeal`/`importData` | `mealSafe` rejects non-{Low,Medium} GI; `placeMeal` guards GI; import re-vet inherits it. | S |
| ✅ | **PIPELINE-DRIFT** | Promote pipeline coerced unknown GI→"Low" and never applied the GD predicate; header falsely claimed gate parity. | High | `scripts/lib/recipe.mjs` | Preserve valid GI (else null); `rejectReason` enforces GI∈{Low,Medium} + added-sugar denylist (shared `hasGdBannedIngredient`); corrected the header claim. | M |
| ✅ | **CI-INV** | The carb↔protein/fat pairing and "no incomplete exclusion map" rules weren't CI-guarded. | Med | `coverage.test.js` | Assert every ≥20g-carb meal pairs carbs w/ protein+fat≥5; independent fish detector proves the Fish exclusion removes every fish recipe. | S |
| ✅ | SAFE-8 | `lookupIngredient` matched raw substrings (unlike the exclusion matcher) → silent macro mis-estimate for novel AI/custom names ("graham cracker"→ham, "spears"→pear). | Low | `nutrition.js` | `lookupIngredient` is now word-boundary aware (with light plural handling), mirroring the exclusion matcher — verified 0 recognition loss across all 2341 bundled ingredient lines, calibration still green. `proteinEstimateReliable` also flags a protein-category ingredient that *mis-matches* a near-zero-protein entry (oil/seasoning/produce), not just unrecognised ones (5 g/100g floor; leanest real protein is tofu at 9 g). | M |
| ✅ | SAFE-9 | `hasGdBannedIngredient` now also catches syrups/malts/refined sugars with no "sugar"/"juice" substring (date/rice/golden syrup, rice/barley malt, dextrose, maltodextrin, turbinado/demerara/muscovado). | Low | `claude.js` | (single-word negator lookback unchanged — backstop only.) | S |

## P1 — Performance / PWA

| St | ID | Item | Sev | Where | Fix | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | **OFFLINE-CACHE** | The SW precached ~1826 photos into one cache capped at 320 → most evicted on first runtime fetch; "true offline" didn't hold. | High | `public/sw.js` | Self-hosted photos now use a permanent, uncapped `LOCAL_IMG_CACHE` (never trimmed); cross-origin stays capped; app shell precached at install. Hashed `/assets/*` + cookbook chunk stay cache-first on first load (covered after one online session). | M |
| ✅ | PERF-1 | Self-host recipe photos for offline. | High | `sw.js`, `recipe-images.js` | 913 self-hosted; offline retention now real via the permanent cache. | L |
| ✅ | PERF-2 | CC-BY/BY-SA require visible attribution wherever shown. | High | `RecipeImage.jsx`, `CookbookTab.jsx` | Detail modal shows full linked TASL ✅; **cards now carry a visible non-interactive credit overlay** (creator · LICENSE) on the photo (`pointerEvents:none` so card click/drag stay intact), covering all 756 BY/BY-SA photos. Cook photos and the detail figcaption suppress the overlay so the credit never double-renders. | M |
| ✅ | PERF-3 | `recipe-images.js` (~168 KB) was statically imported into the eager main chunk via `RecipeImage`. | Med | `recipe-image-store.js`, `RecipeImage.jsx`, `App.jsx` | Split behind a dynamic-import store; App loads it alongside the cookbook chunk. Main chunk 486→318 KB (124→96 KB gzip). | M |
| ✅ | PERF-4 | Render-blocking Google-Fonts `@import`. | High | `index.html` | Moved to `<link>` + preconnect; test-guarded. | S |
| ✅ | PERF-5 | Cache-first navigations served a stale shell after deploy. | Med | `public/sw.js` | Network-first for HTML; cache-first only for hashed assets; test-guarded. | S |
| ✅ | PERF-6 | The `!cookbookReady` gate blanked every tab — even Settings, which needs no cookbook data. | Med | `App.jsx` | Settings renders immediately; planner/cookbook/ingredients/shopping still wait (a saved plan resolves generated/custom ids against the full MEAL_DB, so they genuinely need it). Skeleton gains `aria-busy`. | S |
| ✅ | PERF-7 | `planProps` rebuilt inline every render + un-memoized cards → ~42 cards re-rendered on every toast/selection tick. | Med | `vite.config.js` | Enabled the **React Compiler** (`babel-plugin-react-compiler`, `target: '19'`) in the Vite React plugin, so components/hooks auto-memoize app-wide — no hand-rolled `useCallback`/`memo` to maintain (and none fighting the `react-hooks` recommended lint rules, which are the compiler's own). Verified the built bundle emits the memo-cache runtime (`useMemoCache`/`_c`), all 375 tests + lint + build stay green, and the CSP/`script-src 'self'` still holds. | M |
| ✅ | PERF-8 | Lazy-load + height-based variant ✅; self-hosted photos now also ship a `srcset` (400w/800w) + `sizes` so retina cards stay crisp. The fixed-height wrapper already bounds CLS. | Low | `RecipeImage.jsx` | — | S |
| ✅ | PERF-9 | Manifest shipped SVG-only icons. | Low | `manifest.webmanifest`, `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` | Added 192/512 PNGs ("any maskable") via `npm run icons:png`. | S |
| ✅ | IMG-REMOTE | 76 photos remained remote (rawpixel/StockSnap/pd.w.org — permanent 403s the self-host script can't download): a runtime third-party dependency, not precached, broke offline-before-view. | Med | `recipe-images.js`, `fetch-images.mjs` | **Zero remote photos now.** Taught `fetch-images.mjs` to skip non-self-hostable hosts (rawpixel/StockSnap/WordPress all 403 a server-side download — they were even *preferred* via a quality bonus) and added `--ids` targeting; re-sourced the 57 affected recipes from Commons + Flickr, self-hosted them to local WebP, and renormalised filenames to positional keys. 53/57 got self-hosted galleries; 3 with no on-topic redistributable match (g173/g290/g387) fall back to the clean gradient. | M |

## P2 — Accessibility (WCAG A/AA)

| St | ID | Item | Sev | Where | Fix | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | A11Y-1 | Toasts/moving-banner not announced. | High | `primitives.jsx`, `PlanTab.jsx` | `role`/`aria-live` regions. | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-2 | No `aria-current`; no `<h1>`. | High | `App.jsx` | Added (test-locked). | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-3 | Background scrolled behind modals. | Med | `primitives.jsx` `Modal` | Body scroll-lock on mount. | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-4 | Enter+Space activation ✅; gallery dots are real `<button>`s ✅; the nested-interactive violation is resolved by de-roling the card containers (focusable `tabIndex`+`onClick`+`onKeyDown`, no longer ARIA buttons, so nested action buttons are valid) ✅ — drag-and-drop preserved. | Med | `MealCard.jsx`, `CookbookTab.jsx` | — | M |
| ✅ | A11Y-5 | Color-only states: tabs have underline+aria ✅; cookbook filter toggle chips now carry a visible check-icon cue in the on-state (not colour/opacity alone) ✅; dimmed plan slots already carry descriptive text ("empty — add… or relax a dislike"). | Med | `CookbookTab.jsx`, `App.jsx` | — | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-6 | Cap over-guidance hint ✅, cookbook skeleton has `aria-busy` ✅, and carb-target inputs announce the 5 g clamp via `aria-describedby` ✅. | Med | `SettingsTab.jsx`, `App.jsx` | (servings/protein inputs could get the same hint later.) | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-7 | Shopping remove buttons ≥28px, gallery dots an 8px tap pad, and the mobile tab bar bumped to 12px text with a 48px min target. | Low | `App.jsx`, `ShoppingTab.jsx`, `RecipeImage.jsx` | — | S |
| ✅ | A11Y-8 | Skip-to-content link → `#main-content` ✅; `OfflineBanner` (`navigator.onLine`, role=status) ✅; iOS A2HS tip ✅; Android/desktop one-tap Install via `beforeinstallprompt` ✅. | Low | `App.jsx`, `OfflineBanner.jsx`, `A2HSBanner.jsx` | — | M |

## P3 — Testing & CI

| St | ID | Item | Where | Add | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | TEST-1 | Servings scaling. | `MealDetail.test.jsx` | Scaling 2→4→1 covered. | S |
| ✅ | TEST-2 | AI paths / `callClaude`. | `claude.test.js`, `App.jsx`, `IngredientsTab.jsx` | `callClaude` transport unit-tested; every App AI path now covered (mocked, real vetting): AI-swap error (plan untouched) + success ("Swapped in"); generate-week success (7-day plan commits + new meals persist); grow-cookbook success (vetted meals land + toast); ingredient suggestions success ("Fresh ideas from Claude") + GD-breaking idea filtered out. | M |
| ✅ | TEST-3 | Error branches. | `App.jsx` | `importData` malformed + re-vet ✅; `loadCookbook` reject→`CORE_DB` fallback (shell resolves, no skeleton hang) ✅; null-slot rendering (empty-slot affordance, no crash) ✅. | M |

| ✅ | TEST-5 | `pickBest` randomness. | `planner.test.js` | Seeded (`vi.spyOn(Math,'random')`) ranking + exclude/fallback/empty-pool edges. | S |
| ✅ | TEST-6 | No coverage tooling/gate. | CI, `vite.config.js` | `@vitest/coverage-v8` + `test:coverage` + a lenient ≥68% v8 threshold (current ~74–77%); CI runs it. | M |
| ✅ | TEST-7 | Node drift: CI/deploy pinned 24, docs say 20+, no `engines`. | `package.json`, `.github/workflows/*` | `engines: node >=20`; CI + deploy aligned to Node 22 LTS. | S |
| ✅ | TEST-8 | `dist/index.html` build-smoke in CI + deploy ✅; `jest-axe` a11y smoke on Onboarding ✅ (document-structure rules scoped out for the standalone component). | CI | — | S |

## P4 — Architecture & maintainability

| St | ID | Item | Where | Fix | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ARCH-1 | `INGREDIENT_NAMES` was an ESM `let` re-bound in `loadCookbook` and read in render → the picker was frozen to core-only vocabulary. | `meals.js`, `PrefsFields.jsx`, `App.jsx` | Dropped the live binding; App derives ingredient names from the loaded cookbook and threads them as a prop through Onboarding/SettingsTab → PrefsFields. | M |
| ✅ | ARCH-2 | ~13 set-and-persist wrappers + `K`-enumeration in 4 places; `removeCustomMeal`/undo re-inlined persistence. | `App.jsx` | `usePersistentState(key, initial, hydrate)` hook; reset/import drive the setters; the inline per-key persistence is gone. | M |
| ✅ | ARCH-3 | No error boundary. | `App.jsx` | `ErrorBoundary` wraps `<main>`. | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-4 | Macro-pill markup duplicated. | components | `<NutritionPills>` primitive. | M |
| ✅ | ARCH-5 | Busy resets outside `finally`. | `App.jsx` | Moved to `finally`. | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-6 | `extractJSON` now prefers a fenced ```json block body, so a stray brace in trailing prose no longer breaks parsing. | `claude.js` | — | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-7 | `storage.js` treated quota errors as plain unavailability → silent in-memory switch, data lost on reload (same class as user-photo quota loss). | `storage.js`, `App.jsx` | `store.set` now reports whether the write persisted and fires a one-shot `onStorageFull` listener on a genuine quota overflow (cross-browser `isQuotaError`, distinct from an absent/sandboxed store which stays silent); App subscribes and toasts so the cook can export a backup or free space. | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-8 | `vetNewMeals` deduped on a weaker name key than the pipeline. | `claude.js` | Now uses a punctuation-insensitive `nameKey` mirroring the pipeline. | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-9 | "per 2 servings" magic constant. | utils | `RECIPE_SERVINGS` + `scaleIngredient`. | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-10 | `buildWeek` double `setPlan`. | `App.jsx` | Single set (branch on empty). | S |
| ✅ | ARCH-11 | Non-issue: `fetch-images.mjs` already bounds 429 retries (`MAX_429_RETRIES = 5`) with backoff and throws after. | `scripts/fetch-images.mjs` | — | S |
| ✅ | **PR41-SHOP** | ShoppingTab seeded edits once at mount; a plan/week change while mounted kept stale edits and clobbered the new week's record. | `App.jsx`, `ShoppingTab.jsx` | ShoppingTab is keyed on `plan.weekStart`, so a week change remounts it with that week's stored edits. | S |
| ✅ | **PR41-PHOTOS** | Reset clears IndexedDB photos ✅; backups now round-trip user photos ✅; `saveUserPhotos` reports failure so `addUserPhoto` reverts + toasts on quota ✅; `image.js` auto-orients via `createImageBitmap` ✅. | `userPhotos.js`, `image.js`, `App.jsx` | — | M |

## P5 — Security & robustness hardening

| St | ID | Item | Sev | Where | Fix | Eff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | SEC-1 | No CSP on an app holding a live API key in localStorage. | Med | `src/lib/csp.js`, `vite.config.js` | Build-only `<meta>` CSP (dev/HMR untouched): `connect-src 'self' https://api.anthropic.com`, `script-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`; img https/data/blob, fonts gstatic. Unit-tested; preview smoke clean. *(A real-browser console check before merge is still worthwhile.)* | M |
| ✅ | SEC-2 | Backup embedded the API key in plaintext; import trusted arbitrary JSON. | Low→Med | `App.jsx` export/import | Export **redacts `apiKey`** ✅; import now **type-validates every field** before applying it (arrays/objects where expected; a plan must carry a `days` array) so a hand-edited/corrupt backup can't poison state or crash the planner — malformed fields are ignored, well-formed ones replace — on top of the custom-meal re-vet. | S |
| ✅ | SEC-3 | `normalizeAiMeal` now bounds model-output string lengths (name 120, tags 40, ingredient name 80 / unit 24) and caps ingredients at 30. | Low | `claude.js` | — | S |
| ✅ | CLAUDE-ROBUST | Defensive parse (text→JSON, HTTP status surfaced) + one Retry-After-aware retry on 429/529 ✅; the model is now **a Settings picker** (`AI_MODELS` allowlist: Sonnet 4.6 default · Opus 4.8 best-quality · Haiku 4.5 fastest) threaded through every `callClaude` path. Default stays Sonnet 4.6 (changing it would silently raise the cook's API spend); `resolveModel` clamps any stray/imported id back to the default so a bad value can't reach the API. | Med | `claude.js`, `SettingsTab.jsx`, `meals.js` | — | S |
| ✅ | IMG-LICENSE | `isRedistributable` allowlist (cc0/pdm/by/by-sa) gates self-host downloads ✅; the self-host fetch now uses an **honest, descriptive User-Agent** (tool + contact, per Wikimedia's UA policy) instead of a spoofed Chrome string — the spoof only existed for rawpixel/StockSnap, which are no longer sourced (IMG-REMOTE), and Commons + Flickr serve fine to a descriptive agent. | Med | `self-host-images.mjs` | — | S |

## P6 — Product direction (after hardening)

Not defects — directions once P0–P2 land: ~~glucose logging + weekly trends~~
(shipped — see below); ✅ recipe photos removed pending quality replacement
(done — see below); ⭐ generated recipe photos (scoped, top priority — see
below); cookbook growth to ~750–780 (scoped — see below); meal ratings feeding
the planner; richer print/export.

**✅ Done — recipe photos removed.** Users reported the fetched-photo pipeline
(`scripts/fetch-images.mjs`, matching Openverse/Commons/Flickr photos by
**keyword against title/tags, never the actual pixels**) produced low-quality,
often-irrelevant photos. Rather than leave a known-bad set live, `RECIPE_IMAGES`
was emptied entirely (`{}`) and the ~2,400 committed WebP files deleted —
every recipe now shows the existing deterministic gradient + emoji placeholder,
which `RecipeImage.jsx` was already built to handle gracefully (zero component
changes needed). `images:fetch`/`images:self-host` are **paused, do not run** —
see `scripts/README.md`. This is the interim state; the real fix is below.

**⭐ Next up (top priority) — `IMAGE-GEN` generated recipe photos.** Replace
the empty photo set with AI-generated soft watercolor/illustration images (one
per recipe, style deliberately chosen over pixel art to match the app's
cream/sage/serif identity), QA'd by Claude vision via the Batch API before
acceptance so relevance is verified, not assumed. Full architecture, phased
plan, cost estimates, and the open decisions left (provider choice, exact
prompt template) are in **`docs/IMAGE_GEN_PLAN.md`** — read that before
starting. Blocked on an image-gen provider API key (deliberately not yet
obtained — keeping this free until funded). Will also need a
`LOCAL_IMG_CACHE` SW cache-version bump when photos return (replacing bytes at
existing ids, unlike prior growth batches which only added new ids).

**Next up — cookbook growth to ~750–780.** A data-backed gap analysis found the
binding constraint is the 161-ingredient nutrition-table vocabulary, not a lack
of dish ideas (recent additions had to be named things like "Miso-less Tofu
Bowl" for ingredients the table doesn't recognize). Full priority order —
expand the vocabulary table first, then snacks (40% nut-based, the single
biggest exclusion-pool hit in the library), then egg-free breakfasts — is in
**`docs/LIBRARY_GROWTH_TARGETS.md`**.

**Shipped — `GLUCOSE-1` blood-sugar log.** A new **Log** tab records the four
standard GD checks (fasting + one hour after each main meal) in mg/dL, flags each
reading against editable targets (fasting ≤95, post-meal ≤140 — Settings) with
text-and-colour cues, and shows a 7-day in-range trend plus recent days you can
tap to backfill. Pure logic in `lib/glucose.js` (classification + stats); state
persists to `ss_glucose` and rides the existing backup/restore/reset paths.
A built-in **CSV export** (Log tab → "Export CSV") writes a printable, oldest-first
log with each slot's target in the header — for handing to a care team, separate
from the JSON app backup. Each weekly-summary slot card also draws a small
inline-SVG **trend sparkline** (target reference line + status-coloured points,
no chart dependency; decorative/aria-hidden since the avg + in-range % carry the
data textually). A Settings **post-meal check-timing** toggle switches between the
1-hour (≤140) and 2-hour (≤120) regimens — picking one resets the after-meals cap
to that standard and re-labels the post-meal slots ("2h after lunch") everywhere,
including the CSV header. A **Meal patterns** card joins each post-meal reading to
the meal eaten in that slot (across the live plan + week history) and shows the
average reading per meal — built **descriptive, not causal**: gated behind a
minimum reading count, framed as "patterns to explore with her care team", no
spike-blaming. Follow-ups if wanted: a bedtime reading; surfacing insights in the
cookbook/planner (e.g. nudging steady meals up the pool) once enough data exists.

**Strategic fork — backend proxy.** Sharing plans, real API-key security, and
"feed user photos back into the shared library" (the original wishlist item) are
all blocked on the same thing: a small serverless proxy (e.g. a Cloudflare
Worker) that moves the key off the client and enables multi-user. It would,
however, break the "no backend, fully private" identity that's currently a core
value. Recommendation: stay backend-free through Phases 1–5, then decide this
deliberately. Adopting it would re-classify several Low security items as High.
